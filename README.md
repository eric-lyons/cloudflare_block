# Cloudflare Log Analytics Block

## How to implement this Block

Make sure you have a Looker account up and running. If you are using BigQuery, please follow Looker instructions on how to connect Bigquery to Looker.Please be aware that certain syntax may need to be modified for alternate database connections. Once itâ€™s done you will need to go to the github repository and download the files below. Once you downloaded the files, drag them into your LookML project, or copy and paste the text.

You should replace the connection name in the model file with yours. All the table names need to be updated to the customer's table names as well. If you decided to rename the filenames of explore, model name and view, then please make sure to update all mentions within the other files, else this will result in errors.
